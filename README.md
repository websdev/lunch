# Lunch Club

## Rules

* "Be Excellent To Each Other"


## Contributing

Make a pull request against the repo and publicize your intent to share something!

It's completely OK to introduce tentative entries with a 'TBD' date
(imagine a scenario where you want to share something, but you aren't ready to commit to a date yet).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.


## Presenting

If your discussion requires a presentation, the `README.md` can be used to automagically
generate and open a presentation via npm's `start` task with some additional parameters.

Presentations are powered by the awesome [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)
library which is a dependency of this repo - be sure to `npm install` if you plan to present.

The `start` task takes the following arguments:

`presentationFile` (required) which needs to be a root-relative path to the markdown file
containing the "slides".

`revealOptions` (optional) is escaped JSON which is passed to the reveal.js presenter.
[Here are the options](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#configuration).

`theme` (optional) is a root-relative path to the stylesheet to use for the presentation.
When this option is omitted, the presenter will first look for a stylesheet adjacent to the passed
`presentationFile`.  If nothing is given or found, this will default to reveal.js's `black` theme.

Example:

```
npm start presentationFile="resources/2015-04-20/README.md"
```

In the example above, since `resources/2015-04-20/README.md` has an adjacent `style.css`, it will render
a special stylesheet without needing an additional `theme=` parameter to be passed.

A number of themes are available through the reveal.js dependency that will not
require any additional CSS to be written. Just pass a path to the `theme` argument,
e.g. `theme="./node_modules/reveal.js/css/theme/white.css"`.

PDFs can be generated from presentations with the `?print-pdf` query param.

In presentations, [two line breaks](presentation.ejs#L19) will create a new vertical slide.
[Three line breaks](presentation.ejs#L18) will create a new horizontal slide.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While running the presentation framework, when viewing the slides from your browsers you can use these helpful keyboard shortcuts:

* <kbd>s</kbd> ('s' key) -> Enters 'presenter' mode, which opens another window showing the current slide, any notes you've added (that shouldn't be displayed), a clock showing the time and how long you've been presenting, and a preview of the next slide
* <kbd>ESC</kbd> | <kbd>o</kbd> (escape or 'o' key) -> Zooms out to a high level thumbnail view of all the slides

## Reading the Slides

Often times markup-like code is added to the presentations to allow for things like slide "fragments".

"Fragments" are revealed when the presenter wants to show them
(instead of everything being displayed at once when the slide is presented).

If you're just reading the content of the slides you probably want to remove that extra code.

You can view the notes without that extra code with something like this:

``` sh
sed s/\<\!--\.\*--\>//g resources/2015-05-01/README.md | less
```

And here's an example for vim with Markdown syntax highlighting:

``` sh
sed s/\<\!--\.\*--\>//g resources/2015-05-01/README.md | vim - -c "set syntax=markdown"
```
